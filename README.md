Description:
    The current project is a basic website which contains the recipes of three dishes. The website consists of a main index page which links to three other pages, each of which contains the recipes of the three particular dishes respectively.

    The website showcases the use of basic HTML tags such as <p>, <h1...6>, <a>, and <img>

    It also utlilzes ordered lists <ol>, and unordered lists <ul>, in the displaying of ingredients and step by step recipe instructions.
